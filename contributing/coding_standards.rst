Coding Standards
================
Phoenix code should adhere to the `Symfony Coding Standards<http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html>'_. Make yourself familiar with them.

.. warning:: Much of the code in Phoenix does not hold to these standards. If you see code that needs attention please look to refactor the bundle first before making a PR to fix coding standard issues. See :ref:`The Phoenix Bundle Refactoring Guide<phoenix-bundles-refactoring-guide>` for more


Best Practices
==============
	- Use .yml for denfining bundle configuration
	- Use .yml for defining doctrine entities
	- Don't use annotations
