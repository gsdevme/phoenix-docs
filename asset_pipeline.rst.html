Phoenix Asset Pipeline
######################

This is a guide for how to work with CSS/JS when contributing to the code phoenix framework.



Theory:

Js Assets


'Phoenix wide (framework)' code managed with bower into bower_components. From there gulp should install to
'AdminBundle/Resources/public' to be loaded by base templates.

Other bundles are responsible for managing their own assets pipeline, but for each Phoenix bundle that includes code for the backend a distinct gulp file should exist. - IS THIS RIGHT? Maybe we can get gulp to process other files by convention?!


// tooling - how to install what you need and how to use it

// source maps?

// folder naming conventions and input files - convention over configuration
css/js

//components?

- Headers with toolbars
- Boostrap do and don't (mostly dont)
- Using susy
- Pagination and datatables
