Components

:ref:`The Component documentation<phoenix-component-index>` describes the components used in Phoenix.

Model
=====
:ref:`The Model documentation<phoenix-model-index>` describes the model layer of Phoenix, including how to alter the model via commands.

Bundles

:ref:`The Bundle documentation<phoenix-bundles-index>` describes the bundles used in Phoenix.

Asset Pipeline
==================
A guide to working with assets within the Phoenix admin area. Assetic has been deprecated from our workflow and all backend components should have assets generated using gulp/bower/npm/libsass. This applies to working with core Phoenix bundles, but also to working with your own bundles which integrate with the core framework. Find out how to do this by reading @wip

:ref:`The Roadmap documentation<phoenix-contributing-roadmap>` outline the current state of development, and priorities of the Phoenix team.
:ref:`The Coding Standards documentation<phoenix-contributing-coding-standards>` outlines the coding standards of the project and agreed best practices on contributing code.
